# Bed availability Management System
Spring Boot application
In the current pandemic situation, there was a dedicated capacity of overall beds in dedicated Covid hospitals and centers followed by ICU beds, oxygenated beds, and ventilators. The ICU bed availability software checks for availability of bed nearby, depending on the type of bed required and the hospital preferred. User can search for the beds in the hospital based on their requirements such as (price, hospital, locality, oxygen availability etc.)
